    <h2>What is SIP?</h2>
    <p>A <b>Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)</b> is a method of investing in mutual funds where a fixed sum is invested at regular intervals, typically monthly or quarterly.</p>

    <h2>How SIP Works:</h2>
    <p>When you invest through SIP, you buy units of a mutual fund at different price points based on the market's performance. Over time, this helps you accumulate units at an average price, known as <b>rupee cost averaging</b>.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of SIP:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Start Small:</b> SIP allows you to invest with as little as ₹500 per month, making it accessible for beginners and those with limited capital.</li>
        <li><b>Long-Term Wealth Creation:</b> Regular, disciplined investing over a long period allows you to build significant wealth, taking advantage of the power of compounding.</li>
        <li><b>No Need to Time the Market:</b> SIPs eliminate the stress of trying to predict market movements, as investments are made automatically over time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example of SIP Growth:</h2>
    <p>Suppose you invest ₹1,000 per month in an equity mutual fund with an average annual return of 12%. Over 10 years, your total investment of ₹1,20,000 could grow to over ₹2,30,000 due to compounding and consistent market returns.</p>

    <h2>Disadvantages to Consider:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Market Dependency:</b> While SIP reduces volatility, it doesn’t remove the inherent risks associated with equity markets.</li>
        <li><b>Low Flexibility in Returns:</b> Returns may be lower during poor market conditions, and the growth can vary depending on market performance.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>SIP is a great tool for long-term financial planning, especially for those who want to benefit from disciplined investing without needing to time the market.</p>
