            <h1>What is a Fixed Deposit?</h1>
            <p>A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) </p>
        <p>where you can deposit a lump sum amount for a fixed tenure at a predetermined interest rate.</p>
        <p> The interest rate is usually higher than that of a regular savings account, and the returns are guaranteed.</p>

        <h2>How to Use a Fixed Deposit</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose a Bank or NBFC:</strong> Select a financial institution that offers competitive interest rates and favorable terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Decide the Amount and Tenure:</strong> Determine how much money you want to deposit and for how long. The tenure can range from 7 days to 10 years.</li>
        <li><strong>Open an FD Account:</strong> You can open an FD account online through net banking or by visiting the branch.</li>
        <li><strong>Deposit the Money:</strong> Transfer the amount you wish to invest into the FD account.</li>
        <li><strong>Receive Interest:</strong> Interest can be received periodically (monthly, quarterly, annually) or at maturity, depending on your preference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Fixed Deposits Can Be Helpful</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> FDs are considered a safe investment as they offer guaranteed returns and are not affected by market fluctuations.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictable Returns:</strong> You know exactly how much you will earn at the end of the tenure.</li>
        <li><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> Certain FDs offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.</li>
        <li><strong>Loan Facility:</strong> You can avail loans against your FD, which can be useful in emergencies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Formula to Determine FD Maturity Amount</h2>
    <div class="formula">
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> A = P (1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A:</strong> Maturity amount</li>
            <li><strong>P:</strong> Principal amount (initial deposit)</li>
            <li><strong>r:</strong> Annual interest rate (in decimal)</li>
            <li><strong>n:</strong> Number of times interest is compounded per year</li>
            <li><strong>t:</strong> Number of years</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Advantages of Fixed Deposits</h2>

            <li><strong>Guaranteed Returns:</strong> Fixed interest rates ensure you receive the promised returns.</li>
